## Context
This project involves three key roles/domains: software engineers, data engineers, and data analysts. The focus of this project is on the last step of the data flow, where the data analysts use the data in the data warehouse to create a dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the data.

## Data Flow
The data flow for this project involves three key roles/domains: software engineers, data engineers, and data analysts. The data flow starts with the creation and management of a MySQL database for online transaction processing (OLTP) by the software engineers. The data is then moved from the OLTP database to a data warehouse by the data engineers, using an ETL (extract, transform, load) process. The data warehouse stores and organizes the data for online analytical processing (OLAP). Finally, the data analysts use the data in the data warehouse to create a dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the data.
